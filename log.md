# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've done some work on FreeCodeCamp's Weather App. Currently I have created HTML skeleton and project structure for the app. I also have created several functions for determination of the current user position and also got the API for that position.

**Thoughts** I have experience in coding, but today it was a bit hard to concentrate and work properly. There were a lot of small errors that I couldn't find for a long time.
