### Day 5: 22.05.2018 (Tue, May)

**Today's Progress**: Continue work on Node. Set up and run server with `express` and `nodemon`. Added `.sass` files support for `Let's Do Smth`. Added a new functionality for the `Drum Kit`: after button pressed, the info displays for 1.5 sec.

**Thoughts**: Figuring out Node and REST API. It is needed to add `ESlint`, `dev` and `build` configs, `.babelrc` file to the setup of `Let's Do Smth` app. Needs to add all other buttons even without sound for `Drum Kit`.
